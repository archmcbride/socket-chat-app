# WebSocket Chat App

Extend the code from the lecture about websockets to build a more functional chat application. 
This is a fairly open-ended assignment. Depending on how deep you want to dive into web sockets, you might want to add more HTML and CSS to style the 'red vs blue' chat, or you might want to add more features to the socket server if you're feeling ambitious.

Suggestions:
- Add some CSS so that the 'red vs blue' chat looks more like  a real chat (borders on messages, color-coded by team, etc).
- add sound effects that notify users when someone logs in, logs off, or sends a message.
- Add a news feed, so that any user can post a status, or do some other action, and every other logged in user gets a notification of what just happened. 
- Add private messaging, by integrating socket.io with our authentication code from last week, so that users can log in, and send messages to other logged in users. 
- Add any other features that you think a chat application or social network should have.
